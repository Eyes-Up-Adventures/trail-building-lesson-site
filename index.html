      <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
      <p>
        Building a sustainable trail begins with understanding how water and users
        interact with the terrain. The following principles are drawn from the
        International Mountain Bicycling Association&rsquo;s (IMBA) guide to building
        “sweet singletrack.”
      </p>
      <h3>Half Rule</h3>
      <p>
        A trail&rsquo;s grade should never exceed half the grade of the hillside or
        sideslope it traverses. For example, if the hillside slopes at
        20&nbsp;percent, the trail grade should be less than 10&nbsp;percent. This
        prevents water from running down the tread and causing erosion.
      </p>
      <h3>Ten Percent Average Guideline</h3>
      <p>
        Sustainable trails typically maintain an average grade of
        about 10&nbsp;percent or less. Keeping the overall grade low minimizes
        soil loss and allows the trail to undulate across the landscape rather
        than climb directly up slopes. Steeper sections may be appropriate
        briefly when soil and conditions allow.
      </p>
      <h3>Grade Reversals</h3>
      <p>
        Frequent grade reversals—short dips followed by a rise—force water off
        the trail and add rhythm and fun for users. These features should occur
        every 20–50&nbsp;feet and divide the trail into smaller segments, each
        draining itself.
      </p>
      <h3>Outslope</h3>
      <p>
        The tread should tilt slightly down the hillside (typically around
        5&nbsp;percent) so that water sheets off rather than running along the
        trail.
      </p>
      <h3>Corridor Clearing</h3>
      <p>
        Before digging, the trail corridor must be cleared of low‑hanging
        branches and brush. Most trails require a corridor 8&nbsp;feet tall and
        wide enough for a single user; equestrian trails need a 10‑foot tall
        corridor. Clearing vegetation improves sightlines and safety.
      </p>

      <h3>Where to Build</h3>
      <p>
        Careful site selection is essential for sustainability. During the design
        process, identify control points on your map: <strong>positive</strong>
        control points such as scenic vistas, rock outcroppings or boulder gardens,
        healthy forest stands, and gentle side slopes you want to visit, and
        <strong>negative</strong> control points you want to avoid.  Negative points
        include low‑lying <em>wet areas</em>, wetlands, riparian zones, sensitive
        wildlife habitat, seeps, and flat ground that may hold water or sand.  By
        marking these features on a topographic map you can visualize the land and
        choose alignments that link the positives while skirting the negatives.
        A well‑planned route follows natural contours and avoids problematic terrain.
      </p>
      <h3>Design Process</h3>
      <p>
        IMBA recommends an 11‑step process for designing new trails: obtain
        permission from land managers, identify property boundaries and
        sensitive areas, choose target users, locate control points (features
        like views and creek crossings), arrange loops and a contour route,
        determine desired trail flow (gentle, rolling, or technical), flag the
        general corridor and create a construction plan, conduct environmental
        assessments, and finally flag the exact alignment before construction.

      <h2>Trail Drawing Exercise</h2>
      <p>
        The best way to learn trail layout is to experiment on a map. Below is a
        topographic basemap of the Rangeley, Maine region. Click on the map to
        sketch a potential trail alignment—each click adds a point to your route.
        The total length of your drawn path updates automatically. Use the
        “Reset Path” button to clear the drawing and start over.

      <h2>Instructional Videos</h2>
      <p>
        Watching experts build and shape trails can be incredibly helpful. Here are two
        instructional videos from the mountain‑biking community that demonstrate
        sustainable trail construction and feature building. These are hosted on YouTube
        for easy viewing and sharing.
